This program was specifically written to convert a CSV file exported
from Outlook 365 (or Outlook 2019 I guess) to a vcard 3.0 file
that could be imported into iCloud.

I found out that iCloud doesn't properly handle the lines that look
like

  TEL:TYPE=XXX,YYY,ZZZ:blah

They have to be reformatted as 

  TEL:TYPE=XXX;TYPE=YYY;TYPE=ZZZ:blah

The python vobject cannot export phone numbers in the latter format.
A super hacky workaround is to just open vim and run the following search
and replaces:

%s/,VOICE,PREF/;TYPE=VOICE;TYPE=PREF/
%s/,VOICE/;TYPE=VOICE/
%s/,FAX/;TYPE=FAX/
